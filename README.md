Hi, I'm Lev!

I have been using my GitHub primarily as a way of reinforcing my learning process. I upload code to document the small lessons a learn everyday and review them on my phone when I'm sitting idly and not near a computer. Most of the code I have uploaded serves some personal educational function rather than any real world application. As such, most of my code is in the Teaching-Myslef-the-Basics repo.

Most of the professional projects I have worked on have been freelance work for private companies that have not given me their consent to make the work I have done for them public. Because of this, I don't have much on here as of yet. However, I do have all the code on my system and I could show it in person upon request.
